Beginner phone directory project from Satr course
This is the first project I created through the Satr educational platform course. It is a phone directory that receives a number and returns the name of its owner. Some restrictions were applied, such as the number not exceeding 10 digits. I'm sharing the code that I challenged myself to write. Please note that this is a beginner-level code.

I hope it helps you even in a small way.
Thank you!
